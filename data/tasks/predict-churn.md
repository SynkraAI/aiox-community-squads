# Predict Churn - Customer Risk Prediction & Intervention System

## Purpose

Systematic churn prediction task based on Nick Mehta's Customer Success methodology from Gainsight. This task transforms reactive churn management ("they canceled, why?") into proactive risk identification ("who might cancel, and how do we save them?").

Churn doesn't happen suddenly—it builds up silently through declining engagement, unresolved issues, and eroding value perception. This task provides the complete framework to identify, score, and intervene before customers leave.

## When to Use

- **PROACTIVELY** - Building a churn early warning system from scratch
- **REACTIVELY** - After unexpected churn to prevent similar losses
- **STRATEGICALLY** - During QBRs to prioritize CS resources
- **OPERATIONALLY** - Weekly/monthly risk reviews
- **CRISIS MODE** - Renewal period with concerning signals

## Primary Agent

```yaml
primary_agent: nick-mehta
supporting_agents:
  - peter-fader  # CLV context for prioritization
  - sean-ellis   # Growth metrics correlation

nick_mehta_perspective:
  core_belief: "Churn is a symptom, not the disease. The disease is failure to deliver customer success."

  key_insight: |
    "If customers achieve their desired outcomes through your product,
    they don't churn. Churn prediction is really success prediction inverted."
```

│     - Contract not renewed at term                                           │

│     - Customer downgrades plan                                               │
│     - Reduces seats/users                                                    │
│     - Decreases usage-based spend                                            │

  contractual_churn:
    definition: "Customer terminates contract or fails to renew"
    measurement_point: "Renewal date + grace period (if any)"
    grace_period_days: [0 | 7 | 30 | custom]

  activity_churn:
    definition: "No meaningful activity for X consecutive days"
    activity_threshold:
      metric: [logins | transactions | api_calls | custom]
      minimum_value: ____
      time_window_days: ____

  revenue_churn:
    definition: "MRR decreased by X% or more"
    threshold_percentage: ____

  prediction_window:
    target: "Predict churn X days before it happens"
    days_before_churn: [30 | 60 | 90]
    rationale: "Allows time for intervention"

```

### Step 2.3: Signal Validation

```
SIGNAL VALIDATION PROCESS:

For each potential leading indicator, validate:

1. CORRELATION WITH CHURN
   Question: "Do customers who show this signal churn more often?"

   Analysis:
   - Calculate churn rate for customers WITH signal
   - Calculate churn rate for customers WITHOUT signal
   - Signal is valid if: WITH > WITHOUT by significant margin

   Example:
   - Customers with >50% login decline: 47% churn in 90 days
   - Customers without login decline: 8% churn in 90 days
   - Lift: 5.9x → VALID SIGNAL

2. LEAD TIME
   Question: "How far in advance does this signal appear?"

   Analysis:
   - Identify when signal first appeared for churned customers
   - Calculate average days between signal and churn
   - Signal is actionable if lead time > intervention time

   Example:
   - Champion departure detected: avg 67 days before churn
   - Intervention playbook needs: 30 days
   - Lead time sufficient → ACTIONABLE SIGNAL

3. ACTIONABILITY
   Question: "Can we do something about this signal?"

   Analysis:
   - Define intervention for each signal
   - Estimate success rate of intervention
   - Signal is actionable if intervention exists

   Example:
   - Signal: Usage decline 50%
   - Intervention: Re-onboarding, training, use-case discovery
   - Success rate: 35% save rate → ACTIONABLE

4. FALSE POSITIVE RATE
   Question: "How often does signal appear but customer doesn't churn?"

   Analysis:
   - Count times signal appeared
   - Count times signal preceded churn vs didn't
   - Acceptable false positive rate: <40%

   Example:
   - Signal triggered: 100 times
   - Led to churn: 65 times
   - False positive: 35% → ACCEPTABLE

3. Session duration trend (importance: 0.12)
4. Support ticket count (importance: 0.09)
5. Payment failure count (importance: 0.08)

ALERT THRESHOLDS:
- High Risk: >70% probability
- Medium Risk: 40-70% probability
- Low Risk: <40% probability

2. Business review attendance
3. Strategic roadmap alignment
4. Multi-year commitment status
5. Reference/advocacy participation
6. Expansion pipeline

RISK SCORING ADAPTATION:
- Higher weight on relationship signals (40%)
- External signals more important (layoffs, M&A)
- Champion tracking more granular
- Stakeholder depth critical

INTERVENTION DIFFERENCES:
- Every At Risk = executive involvement
- Save offers include strategic elements
- Product roadmap customization
- Contract flexibility (multi-year incentives)

RESULTS:
